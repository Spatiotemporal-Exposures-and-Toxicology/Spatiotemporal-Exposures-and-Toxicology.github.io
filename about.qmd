The **SETgrp** has a broad interest in geospatial exposure modeling and risk assessment for environmental [exposomics](https://factor.niehs.nih.gov/2022/9/feature/2-feature-exposomics-research) (e.g. chemical mixtures, social, behaviorial + environmental factors) through the integration with non-animal toxicological data such as high-through *in vitro* screen assays.

Recently, SETgrp has adopted a test-driven-development ([TDD](https://github.com/topics/test-driven-development)) strategy to its research and software development approach.
