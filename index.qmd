## **Environmental Exposure Assessment and Mechanistically Informed Risk Assessments Using Spatiotemporal Statistics**

## The SETgrp has a broad interest in geospatial exposure modeling and risk assessment for environmental [exposomics](https://factor.niehs.nih.gov/2022/9/feature/2-feature-exposomics-research) (e.g. chemical mixtures, social, behaviorial + environmental factors). Key areas of research include: 

#### ***GeoTox:*** Integration of geospatial exposure with non-animal toxicological data such as high-through *in vitro* screen assays to develop mechanistically-informed risk maps

#### Spatiotemporal exposure mapping of environmental and climate variables

#### Leading and promoting software and computational best-practices such as test-driven-development ([TDD](https://github.com/topics/test-driven-development)) and open-source code for the environmental health sciences
