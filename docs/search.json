    "text": "The common theme of the Spatiotemporal Exposures and Toxicology group (a.k.a. SET group) is spatial statistics methods and applications in population-level exposure and risk assessment. As an investigator in the Division of Translational Toxicology, Dr. Kyle P Messier is expanding to include the integration of toxicological methods into geospatial exposure and risk models. The long-term goals are to use integrated geospatial and toxicological data and methods (1) to characterize the large-scale, population-level internal exposome, (2) to model the source-to-outcome continuum for complex mixtures, and (3) utilize these risk assessment tools to improve lives with an emphasis on historically disadvantaged communities and susceptible populations.\n\n\n\nThe Spatiotemporal Exposures and Toxicology group in October 2023.
