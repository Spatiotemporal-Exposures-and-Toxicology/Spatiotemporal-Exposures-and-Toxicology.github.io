Key areas of research include:\n\nGeoTox: Integration of geospatial exposure with non-animal toxicological data such as high-through in vitro screen assays to develop mechanistically-informed risk maps\n\n\nGeospatial Exposure: Spatiotemporal exposure mapping of environmental and climate variables (e.g. chemical mixtures, social, behaviorial, environmental, and climate factors)\n\n\nSoftware: Developing and promoting software and computational best-practices such as test-driven-development (TDD) and open-source code for the environmental health sciences"
