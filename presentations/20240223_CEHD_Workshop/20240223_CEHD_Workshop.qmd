![](group-intro.png){width="200"} Much discussion: "integration ... models ... privacy"

![](CW-character.png){width="162"}

## Back Story

![](kpm-character.png){width="126"} There are so many PM2.5 models, why do we need another one?

## Back Story

![](kpm-character.png){width="126"}

![](group-intro.png){width="200"}

![](CW-character.png){width="162"} I've had a difficult time finding air pollution models that are available during the same time range as our EHR data

## Back Story

![](kpm-character.png){width="126"} Interesting ... I'll look into developing a PM2.5 model for recent years

## Back Story

![](kpm-character.png){width="126"} I have new group of postdocs and data analysts joining and am worried about how to keep track of their code and knowledge retention

## Back Story

We discuss the idea of a group project focused the development of an air pollution model with regular updates using TDD and CI/CD principles

![](SET-grou-characters-silly.png){width="350"} Sounds good to us!

## Software and Computational Best Practices

-   Test Driven Development
-   Continuous Integration
-   Build Checks
-   Style/Linting
-   Workflows/Pipelines

## Some Geospatial Models From Me {.smaller}

#### That are not FAIR+

::: incremental
1.  Arsenic in North Carolina
2.  Tetrachloroethylene in North Carolina
3.  Nitrate in North Carolina
4.  Radon in North Carolina
5.  Nitrogen Dioxide in the US
6.  Mobile monitoring NO, PM, and BC in the Bay Area

-   Kind of FAIR+
-   Raw data is available for research
-   Modeled data is not readily usable for epidemiology

## Others making exposure data accessible

::: incremental
-   For the most part, these are data catalogs
-   Spatial and temporal domains can be limited
-   Still require a heavy lift on the health researcher to integrate

## SET Group Group Project Intro

::: incremental
-   Goal: Develop an air pollution model for the last 5 years that is updated bi-annually
-   Entire SET group, Cavin Ward-Caviness, Lara Clark, Anisha Singh
-   Test-Driven Development
-   GitHub with strict rules
-   Targets make-like pipeline
-   Fine spatial and temporal resolution
-   Post-processing for aggregated spatial and temporal resolutions
:::

## TDD and Test Coverage {.scrollable}

-   Unit tests: Test a function or very specific piece of code e.g.
-   Does my function return an error when the input is wrong?
-   Does function return the expected value given a set of inputs?
-   expect\_\*
-   Integration tests: Tests the input from function X works with function Y
-   See testthat R package

```
## TDD Philosophy {.scrollable}

![](Raphael.jpg){fig-align="center" width="61%"}

1.  Write a test
2.  Run the test -\> Expect it to fail
3.  Write the minimum code
4.  Run the test -\> Till it passes
5.  Refactor -\> Repeat -\> Complete

## TDD Philosophy {.scrollable}

-   Forces you to think about code requirements
-   Forces explicit testing of code
-   Minimizes bugs

## CI/CD

![](continuous-integration.png)

- Frequent code commits
- Detect Errors Sooner
- Reduces Complexity of Debugging
- Run Code Tests Automatically
- Make Working in Groups Easier


## Style/Linting

- Consistent style --> rEdabIliTY and_maintainability 
- Identifying syn.tax errors;
- Semantic Errors



## Pipelines and Workflows

- A pipeline is a computational workflow that does statistics, analytics, or data science
- Coordinate analysis with a DAG like structure
- Skip steps that are not needed with updates
- Facilitates code and package integration
