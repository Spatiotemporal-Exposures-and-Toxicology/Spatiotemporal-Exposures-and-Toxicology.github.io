:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Matheron and Krige developed geostatistical methods to predict ore content from core samples
-   Matheron coined the term "Kriging" after Krige
-   "Nugget" is a term used to random noise because predicting where gold nuggets were was so difficult

# Classical Models

## Uses in Public Health

-   Estimate exposure to air pollutants, water contaminants, and other environmental stressors

-   Geocode patient addresses to link to environmental exposures

-   Estimate the spatial distribution of disease rates

-   Estimate the spatial distribution of health risk factors

## Land Use Regression

Linear regression for spatial data

$$
Y(s) =  X(s)\beta + \varepsilon
$$

where $Y(s)$ is the response variable, $X(s)$ are the predictor variables, $\beta$ are the regression coefficients, $\varepsilon$ is the iid error term, and $(s)$ denotes the spatial location.

Not a terrible idea for spatial data, but it directly violates the assumption of independence of observations.

## Kriging

Kriging and spatial models provide an explicit term for spatial correlation. A reasonable approach is a random-effect model:

$$
Y(s) = \mu(s) + \varepsilon +  \eta(s)
$$ where $\eta \sim N_n(0,\Sigma_{\theta})$

and $\Sigma_{\theta}$ is a covariance matrix with parameters, $\theta$, that accounts for correlation between spatial and temporal locations

# Source-to-Outcome

## Source-to-Outcome Modeling

![](/presentations/20240214_SOT_ISES_Webinar/Exposome-Cascade.png)

## Source-to-Outcome Modeling

-   Source-to-Outcome is a framework for linking environmental sources to human health outcomes

-   The framework is based on the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concepts

## Source-to-Outcome Modeling

-   Next generation risk of cumulative and total exposomic effects on human health
-   A balance between mechanistic and translational research
-   A framework for integrating multiple data sources and models
-   Incorporate biological and geospatial information on communities and individuals

## Getting Two Frameworks to Work Together

**Aggregate Exposure Pathways**

-   AEP is a comprehensive external analysis of source, media, and transformations

**Adverse Outcome Pathway**

-   AOPs provide a linkage specific biological target, pathway or process by a stressor and an adverse outcome(s) considered relevant to risk assessment

# Conclusions

## Looking Forward

-   The tools for each step of the source-to-outcome modeling framework are available, but the integration is still a work in progress

-   The integration of these tools will allow for the development of a comprehensive source-to-outcome modeling framework that can be used to assess the risk of cumulative and total exposomic effects on human health


## Multiple Assays Informing an AOP 

![](mermaid-diagram-2024-03-08-160259.png){width="115%"}

## Looking Forward


-   Incorporate more refined information on individual and population-level susceptibility to environmental exposures

-   It is going to be a massive code and software development challenge

## Looking Forward

-  Geospatial **exposures** are the foundation of a spatial, total exposome risk approach
