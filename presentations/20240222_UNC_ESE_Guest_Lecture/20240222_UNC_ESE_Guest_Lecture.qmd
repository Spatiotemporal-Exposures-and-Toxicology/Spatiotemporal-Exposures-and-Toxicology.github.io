## The Landscape of Geospatial Exposure Models {.scrollable}

#### The next section will focus on details of geospatial exposure models

Many types of models are used for geospatial exposure assessment.

-   Proximity

-   Index

-   Land Use Regression

-   Geographically Weighted Regression

-   Kriging and Gaussian Processes

-   Machine Learning

-   Mechanistic Models

-   Satellite Imagery

-   Hybrid / Ensemble Models

## Notation: Spatial Random Field

-   $\mathbf{y}$: A single random variable is denoted by a bold lowercase letter
-   $\mathbf{Y}$: Spatial Random Field (SRF): A collection of random variables across a spatial domain.
-   SRF provides full, probabilistic characterization of exposure across space
-   SRF is referenced to a real-valued domain with spatial and temporal indices, $\{\mathbf{Y}(s); s \in \mathbb{R}^2\}$.

## A Review of Linear Regression {.scrollable}

Response

$$
    Y_i \in  \{1, ..., n\} 
$$ $p$ covariates:

$$
    X = X_{i1}, ..., X_{ip}
$$

The model is :

$$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + X_{i1}\beta_1 + , ..., X_{ip}\beta_p
$$

-   The mean is a linear combination of the covariates

$$
E(Y_i) = \mu_i = \beta_0 + X_{i1}\beta_1 + ... + X_{ip}\beta_p
$$

-   Error/Residuals are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid)

$$
\varepsilon_i = Y_i - \mu_i
$$

## Linear Regression for spatial idea

-   As a method, not a terrible idea

-   Unbiased

-   Overconfident error estiamte (p-values, SE)

-   Model Selection (Type 1 and 2 error)

## Land Use Regression

Linear regression for spatial data

$$
    \bY(s) =  X(s)\beta + \varepsilon
$$

$$
    X(s) = X_{i1}(s_1), ..., X_{ip}(s_p)
$$

## Spatial Covariance Model

-   As a random-effect model, we add a spatially explicity error term

$$
    \bY(s) = \mu(s) + \varepsilon +  \eta(s)
$$

-   $\mu(s)$ can take many forms such as linear, nonlinear, or even machine learning models such as random forest.

-   More details on a spatial covariance model later

## Proximity {.scrollable}

-   Proximity based metrics are the most basic form of an exposure assessment because they rely only on the distance between a pollution source and the observed outcome location.

-   A proximity model is simply a deterministic covariate based on distance:

$$
  Y(s) = X(s) 
$$

Given a matrix of distances between monitoring locations and pollution sources, $d_{ij}$, minimum and average distance are:

$$
  X_i^{min} = min(d_{i,\cdot}) \\
  \overline{X}_i = \frac{1}{n_j}\sum_{j=1}^{n_j}d_{ij}\\
$$

Questions:

::: incremental
-   What are examples of proximity metrics? Check all that apply.
-   What are the advantages of a proximity metric? Check all that apply.
:::

## Index Models

-   Index variables are deterministic quantities that summarize (e.g. prinicipal components) multiple complex variables of interest into a simple and interpretable metric.

-   Covariates are made up of geographic variables across different domains

-   Social Vulnerability Index, Climate Vulnerability Index, etc.

## Land Use Regression {.scrollable}

$$
  \bY(s) =  X(s)\beta + \varepsilon
$$ - where $\bY(p)$ are the $n \times 1$ observations for the variable of interest (e.g. PM$_{2.5}$, $NO_3^{-}$, etc.). $X(s)$ is a $n \times k$ design matrix of $k$ spatial geographic covariates

Key Steps

::: incremental
1.  Calculate geographic covariates
2.  Fit the model - may include model selection or dimension reduction
3.  Predict at unmonitored locations
:::

## Geographically Weighted Regression

::: incremental
-   $$   \bY(s) =  X(s)\beta(s) + \varepsilon
     $$
-   What is the key difference between LUR and GWR? Select one. Recall, LUR = $\bY(s) = X(s)\beta + \varepsilon$
-   Hint: It's in the $\beta$
-   ![](GWR.png)
:::

## Gaussian Process and Kriging

::: incremental
-   Gaussian process and Kriging are one in the same
-   Utilize information on spatial correlation to help interpolate
-   Account for spatial error
-   Highly flexible
:::

## Gaussian Process and Kriging {.scrollable}

$$
    \bY(s) = \mu(s) +  \eta(s)
$$

-   $\mu(s)$ can take many forms such as linear, nonlinear, or even machine learning models such as random forest

-   $\eta \sim N_n(0,\Sigma_{\theta}+\tau^2I)$

-   $\Sigma_{\theta}$ is a covariance matrix with parameters, $\theta$, that accounts for correlation between spatial and temporal locations

Question:

::: incremental
-   What physical quantity is $\Sigma_{\theta}$ solely dependent on?
:::

## Machine Learning {.scrollable}

Machine learning (ML) is the general culture, philosophy, or school of thought for predictive modeling that focuses on the learning algorithm and out-of-sample prediction generalization

::: incremental
-   Many common machine learning algorithms can be used for geospatial modeling
-   Flexible
-   Don't make strict assumptions on the distriubtions of the data
-   Coordinates and other spatial information is input as covariates
:::

::: incremental
-   Common Methods in Exposure Modeling
:::

::: incremental
-   Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
-   Random Forest
-   xgboost
-   Neural Networks: CNN, LSTM, GAN, etc.

## Mechanistic {.scrollable}

::: incremental
-   I would be remiss if I didn't mention another entirely different class of exposure models

-   Mechanistic models are not statistical models

-   Mechanistic models are based on physics and chemistry
